# Fuel Delivery Job

## Overview
***No changes as of yet, this is just a fork working on features to add***
In this fuel delivery job, players are required to deliver fuel to different gas stations around Los Santos. The job involves driving a fuel truck and ensuring that the fuel is safely and efficiently delivered to the designated gas stations.

## How to Start

To initiate the job, players must speak to the fuel dispatcher. Once they have the truck and trailer, they will go to the Gas Depot to fill the tanker. After filling the tanker, they will receive a route to a random gas station to deliver the fuel.

Players can repeat this process as many times as they want, delivering fuel to various gas stations around Los Santos.

## Updates and Bug Reporting

The fuel delivery script is constantly being updated to improve the player experience and fix any bugs or issues. If you encounter any problems while using the fuel delivery job, you can report them to Maji#1118 on Discord. Alternatively, you can create a GitHub issue to report any bugs or issues you encounter.

By reporting issues, you help improve the fuel delivery job for all players and contribute to a better gaming experience.
